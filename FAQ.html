        <h2 class="sub-heading">When did you start feeling this way?</h2>
            <hr>
             <p class="content">I've always really liked you as a friend but this summer I started to wonder if there could be something more. 
                 I first decided that I wanted to ask you when we went to the Casino for your Birthday a few months ago. I've been trying to figure out a way to ask since then.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">What would a date look like?</h2>
             <hr>
             <p class="content">There are a lot of things that could be fun! We could eat some really good food and then go do some activity like an escape room or go to an arcade. 
                I am up for anything! I would even go see a horror movie if you wanted.  
             </p>
             <hr>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">What if I just want to stay friends?</h2>
             <hr>
             <p class="content">I would understand. One of my biggest concerns for asking was that I didn't want to jeopardize our friendship or make things awkward.
                If you don't have any interest in a date, I will drop it and things can continue how they have been for the past few years.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">What do you like about me?</h2>
             <hr>
             <p class="content"> So many things. I think you are super smart and funnny and way cooler than me! 
                You have really cool style and are well traveled. You have so many different skills and talents and are an overall really interesting person.  You also destroy me in all games haha.
            </p> 
             <hr>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Why did you make this? </h2>
             <hr>
             <p class="content">I wanted my request to stand out! Maybe it is cheesy, but I wanted to learn about your degree and show that I am really interested in you. 
                You deserve something special. 
             <hr>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Why now?</h2>
             <hr>
             <p class="content">I feel like I have been complacent in life lately. I want to tell people how I feel and I don't want to be afraid to change.
