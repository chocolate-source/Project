        <p>Hi Elissa! This is a website I put together to ask you a question. Would you wanna go out on a date sometime? I really enjoy spending time with you. Here's some of my favorite things that we do:</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Games! I love playing video games and board games with you. Nemesis, Scythe, Dune, Hegemony, Brass, and so many more. </p>

    <hr>
        <p>Eating really good food. Fondue, Steak House, BarTaco, HotPot, and you introduced me to KBBQ! </p>

    <p>During 2024 we started going to the Casino a few times! I have really enjoyed that.</p>

    <p>Travel! We went to Florida and NYC in 2021 and back to Florida in 2022 and 2024. I look forward to more trips and maybe going to Japan in 2025!</p>

    Maybe this is coming out of nowhere for you. I am pretty bad at sharing my feelings and opening up to people but I am trying to be better at it.
    I get it if you don't have any interest and just wanna stay friends. You may have a lot of questions! I also created a 2nd page for these. Obviously just text me about anything too.
